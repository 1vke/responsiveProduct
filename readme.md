# Responsive Product
This repo is a basic HTML5 boilerplate project intended for me to practice responsiveness. It is meant to mimic a shopify e-commerce stores that sell shoes, hence the shoe product.

The "widget" looking element comes with a nice carousel, complete with UI. (I think this is the best one I have made so far)

The biggest thing I took away from this project was how to control the sizes of elements relating to the parent. I did this by setting the desired element's font size units to em, and I changed the parent element font size unit to rem. Upon meeting a media query, a clamp will be activated, changing the size of the parent's font size, also manipulating all of its children, equivalently.

## Usage
Clone the repo and open up the html file
